Using Echo State Networks for Musical Improvisation
===================================================

The code in this repository is for the main application
being built for my final year project.

Ownership
---------

If I have not explicitly authored myself in some source file (namely .h/.c/.cpp files), 
do not assume I am the author. This repository also contains libraries I may have used, which
I am clearly not the author of.


Other Repositories
------------------

Other repositories have also been made for the training data generation part of the project.
This is in a separate repository, stored on my gitlab account at `git.cs.bham.ac.uk`. I will try to link
the two near the end of the project if I can.

Libraries Used
--------------

This list may be incomplete, but some of the libraries I have used are:

* Eigen (Matrix Operations)
* libsndfile (Dealing with audio files)
* PortAudio (Real-time audio library)
* Catch (Unit testing library)
